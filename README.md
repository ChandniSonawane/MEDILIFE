## Technical aspect

This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme. The webapp can predict following Diseases:
* Diabetes
* Breast Cancer
* Heart Disease
* Kidney Disease
* Liver Disease
* Malaria
* Pneumonia

__Models with their Accuracy of Prediction__

Disease | Type of Model | Accuracy
--- | --- | ---
Diabetes | Machine Learning Model | 98.25%
Breast Cancer | Machine Learning Model | 98.25%
Heart Disease | Machine Learning Model | 85.25%
Kidney Disease | Machine Learning Model | 99%
Liver Disease | Machine Learning Model | 78%
Malaria | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 96%
Pneumonia | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 95%

__NOTE__
<br>
==> Python version 3.6.8 was used for the whole project.<br>
